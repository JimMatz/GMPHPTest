        "html": "<h1>Buddy Check Application </h1>  <h3>Scanner setup</h3> The scanner should be set to auto TAB after the scan is complete.  The applications scanable  fields are designed to respond to a TAB or Field Exit.  <h3>Barcode label setup</h3> While doing the initial testing of the application we are using a locally connected barcode printer. (a printer connected to a pc).  When the application goes live we hope to have the bar code printers conneted via the network. <br> <br> Connecting the barcode printer to the application requires a 5250 (green screen) printer session to be created.  You will need the assistance from IT to download the appropriate printer driver and setup the session. some points to remember are <ul>     <li>Use the ASCII print transform (check box)</li>     <li>Printer model should be somthing like *COUNTINOUSE132</li>     <li>Drawer 1 should be Continous 13.2</li>     <li>All other drawers should be *NONE</li>     <li>Use the appropriate Host Print Transform program and library</li>     <lil>The printer session needs to be tied to the print driver </lil> </ul>    <H3>Master</H3>     <p>Creating the master is the 1st step to this process<br>     The master order number can be scanned or entered from the Pick List into the application. <br>     The order number is verified and should display the ship to name and city state zip for verification.           <br> If you would like <b>to default any values</b> press the clear and default button and it will set the copy count and other information as described below.         <br>The copenents you add and how you add them are completely up to you. (Free form text).         <br><b>The compenet ID</b> is used by the application to help with in the creating a unique barcode.  It defaults to the 1st Charecter of the component (in upper case) and is skipped when the normal processes is followed.  You can however position the curor to the ID field and change the value if you wish to do so.         <br>The quantity field will determine how many individule barcode labels will print for that compenet of the order.         <br><b>UOM or Unit of Measure</b> is not required but helps when reviewing the order.  The UOM field should be like EA for Each or BAGS, etc... This is also a free text field of up to 10 Characters         <br><b>Component Notes </b>are just a tool to add reminders for the scanners when the orders is displayed.           <br><b>Press the Add/Update button</b> to save the data you just entered.         <br>You can print the labels at anytime by pressing the save/print button near the top.     <br>         <br>To move to the next order press the New Order button.                             <br><b><i>Note: The data is saved as soon as you press Add/Update so you can exit and Return to the order when needed.</i></b>                  <br>         <h4>To modify or remove a compoenent </h4>     To modify or remove a copenet simply double click on the componenet line of the lower grid of data.  The information will be presented in the fields at the top of the screen with the option to Update or Remove the compoenent as needed.     Make the changes as required and press the appropriate button.                                              </p>   <h3>Scanning Verification</h3> The scanning application by design should be quick and easy.<br> Scan the order number - the ship to and address will be displayed for verification.<br> just scan the compoenets - you cannot scan the same component twice and the component must exist for the specified order. <br> The order count displays and is Red unless the count matches the expected count for that order.   <h3> Character(copy) Counts</h3> The application will count the \"copy\" for the order by<br> Removing spaces Counting 1 for each char with the exception of <ul>     <li>i</li>     <li>j</li>     <li>\"</li>     <li>;</li>     <li>:</li>     <li>?</li>     <li>!</li>     <li>% adds 2</li> </ul> The listed characters will add 2 to the count If the charactor '%' is showen you may need to adjust the count depending on how the charactor is created as a single character or as seperate pieces.  If special charactors are entered you may also need to revise the copy count.   <h3>Patterns</h3> The application will look for items in the order detail for the item of LAYOUT. <br> The application will then create add the \"Pattern\" to the scan with a quantity of what was ordered.  <h3>Kits (optional items to auto add)</h3> it is possible to add additional items such as Hardware based on the the table BUDDYKIT. For example - if the the order has the item/s C18HELVAL or C08HELVAL  These are Hardware bags Though we don't know the specific quantity in each bag we can include the item so you know there should be some sort of hardware assigned.    The quantity is also associated with the quantity ordered.  <br> By default the There is a base quanity muliplier that is set to 1.   If that quantity is 2 high or 2 low you can change that quantity to be a multiple of if more quantity is required or a divisor if the quantity should be a portion of the quantity ordered.  The value will always round Up to the nearest whole number.  So 1.1 will = 2 as an example.",
